# (NED) Neonatal Echocardiographic Dataset

Echocardiography is an indispensable tool for cardiac assessment, enabling clinicians
to capture critical information, both quickly and affordably. However, its potential for
broader accessibility and increased reliability is continuously hindered by the requirement
of short-in-supply, skilled technicians. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
have revolutionized medical image analysis, yet remain under-utilized in cardiology, particularly
in the identification of complex multi-view neonatal echo-cardiograms. This
study aims to look at viewpoint identification as the classification of videos, rather than
images. In doing so, it proposes a CNN-GRU architecture with a novel temporal feature
weaving method, which leverages both spatial and temporal information to yield a
4.33% increase in accuracy over baseline image classification while using only four consecutive frames. Additionally, this work offers the Neonatal Echocardiogram Dataset
(NED) a professionally-annotated dataset which has been open-sourced to encourage
future work and development in this field.
